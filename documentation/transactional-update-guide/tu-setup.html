	<span class="emphasis"><em>transactional-update</em></span> is typically used
	on a read-only root file system, even though it also supports
	regular read-write systems.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tu-setup-var"></a>4.2. /var</h2></div></div></div><p>
	On a system with snapshot support
	<code class="filename">/var</code> should not be part of the
	root file system, otherwise doing a rollback to a previous state would
	also roll back the <code class="filename">/var</code>
	contents. On a read-only system this directory has to be writable in any
	case, variable data is stored inside.
      </p><p>
	Due to the volatile nature of
	<code class="filename">/var</code> the directory will
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be mounted into the new snapshot during the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>transactional-update</em></span> run, as this would
	break atomicity: The currently running system depends on the old state
	of the data (imagine a database migration was triggered by a package).
	Any modifications to <code class="filename">/var</code>
	therefore have to be in the new system, i.e. modifying the contents of
	<code class="filename">/var</code> as part of the packaging
	scripts is not allowed.
      </p><p>
	The only exception to this rule are directories: Those will be
	recreated during the first boot into the updated system by the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service</em></span> helper service. For
	all other cases please use one of the options described in
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_for_transactional-updates" target="_top">Packaging for transactional-updates</a>
	and
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines#Migration_.2F_Upgrades" target="_top">Migration / Upgrade</a>
	in the Packaging guidelines. If a package is breaking this rule by
	installing files into a directory which is not part of the root file
	system, then a warning message indicating the affected file is
	printed at the end of the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>transactional-update</em></span> run.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tu-setup-etc"></a>4.3. /etc</h2></div></div></div><p>
	<span class="emphasis"><em>transactional-update</em></span> also supports
	write operations to <code class="filename">/etc</code> on an
	otherwise read-only file system. To do so an
	<span class="emphasis"><em>overlayfs</em></span> layer is put on top of the system's
	<code class="filename">/etc</code> directory. All modified
	configuration files will end up in the current snapshot's overlay in
	<code class="filename">/var/lib/overlay/&lt;snapshotnum&gt;/etc</code>,
	with each snapshot having one associated overlay directory.
      </p><p>
	The mounted <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory will
	typically consist of three (or more) layers. In
	<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> this may look similar as the following
	entry:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">overlay  /etc  overlay  defaults,upperdir=/sysroot/var/lib/overlay/82/etc,lowerdir=/sysroot/var/lib/overlay/81/etc:/sysroot/var/lib/overlay/76/etc:/sysroot/etc,workdir=/sysroot/var/lib/overlay/work-etc,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/var,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/var/lib/overlay,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/sysroot/var,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/sysroot/var/lib/overlay,x-initrd.mount  0  0</pre><p>
      </p><p>
	The important options are <code class="option">upperdir</code> and
	<code class="option">lowerdir</code>. <code class="option">upperdir</code> references the
	write layer, i.e. the directory the system is currently writing to. If
	a file in <code class="filename">/etc</code> is opened for
	read access, it will first try to open the file from this directory.
	If the file is not present in this layer, then overlayfs will search
	in the <code class="option">lowerdir</code>s from left to right until it finds
	the file, i.e. the layers are <span class="emphasis"><em>transparent</em></span>. The
	last layer is the reference layer and always has to have a complete
	copy of <code class="filename">/etc</code>, all the layers
	above just contain changes to that base layer.
      </p><div class="example"><a name="id1337"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4.1. /etc layers</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
upperdir  (/var/lib/overlay/x/etc)   |       | file2 | file3 | file4 |       |
lowerdir1 (/var/lib/overlay/x-1/etc) |       |       | file3 |       | file5 | file6
lowerdir2 (/etc of snapshot x-2)     | file1 | file2 | file3 |       |       | file6
	</pre><p>
	  Let's have another look from the perspective while an update is
	  running. <em class="replaceable"><code>x</code></em> is the id of the new snapshot
	  where the update is currently being performed.
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>x-1</code></em> is the id of the currently running
	  snapshot, and <em class="replaceable"><code>x-2</code></em> is the id of the
	  snapshot before the currently running one.
      </p><p>
	  <code class="filename">file1</code> is an old file that hasn't been
	  changed in the last two snapshots. Therefore it is only present in the
	  base / lowest overlay. As the file cannot be found in the first two
	  layers, the version from the base layer will be used.</p><p><code class="filename">file2</code> has been changed during the update.
	  The currently running system still sees the old version of the file
	  from the base layer, the updated system will see the new version of
	  the file.
	</p><p>
	  <code class="filename">file3</code> has been changed during the update,
	  but there is also a modification in the currently running system. See
	  the Warning below for details.
	</p><p>
	  <code class="filename">file4</code> was only added in the new snapshot
	  and will only be available there. The currently running system doesn't
	  know anything about it.
	</p><p>
	  <code class="filename">file5</code> was added in the current snapshot.
	  It will also be visible in the new snapshot.
	</p><p>
	  <code class="filename">file6</code> was modified in the current snapshot.
	  It will also be visible in the new snapshot. Basically the same case
	  as <code class="filename">file5</code>.
	</p></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>
	To reduce the number of overlays the contents of the overlays are
	merged into the base layer if a new snapshot is created. Caveat:
	the state of <code class="filename">/etc</code> that is
	synced into the new snapshot is not the	one from the currently
	running system, but the previous one: the files in the current
	system could still be changed before the reboot, and we want these
	changes (e.g. by the admin or a configuration management software)
	to be visible in the new system.
      </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
	  If a file has been modified both in the new snapshot and in the
	  currently running system <span class="emphasis"><em>after the snapshot was
	  created</em></span>, then the changes done in the currently running
	  system will be lost in the new snapshot (see the
	  <code class="filename">file3</code> case from the example above).
	</p><p>
	  When the new snapshot is booted for the first time the systemd
	  service <span class="command"><strong>transactional-update-etc-cleaner</strong></span> will
	  check for these conflicts and print the results to the journal.
	</p></div><p>
	If the <code class="option">--continue</code> option is used multiple times to
        extend a
	new snapshot while the system has not been rebooted, and if that
	snapshot is based on the currently active system, then the
	merge will only run for the first snapshot; the additional
	snapshot layers will be added to <code class="option">lowerdir</code>. This is
	to make sure that changes to the running system will still be
	visible after booting into the new system.
      </p><p>
	The above <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> example is showing such a
	case: <code class="option">lowerdir</code> contains two numbered overlay
	directories. The later directory with number <span class="emphasis"><em>76</em></span>
	indicates the snapshot which was used as a base. As the
	<code class="option">lowerdir</code> contains a second entry with number
	<span class="emphasis"><em>81</em></span> it means that the <code class="option">--continue</code>
	option has been used before the system was rebooted. Gaps in the
        numbers such
	as seen here may indicate that those snapshots were discarded or a
	rollback to snapshot 76 was performed. The lowest snapshot is always
	<code class="filename">/sysroot/etc</code>, containing the
	root file system's contents.
      </p><p>
	As <code class="filename">/etc</code> is mounted by
	<span class="application">dracut</span> during early boot the options have to
	be prefixed with <span class="emphasis"><em>/sysroot</em></span>. The
	<span class="command"><strong>x-systemd</strong></span> options are setting up the volume's
	<span class="application">systemd</span> dependencies correctly.
      </p><p>
	Overlays no longer referenced by any snapshots will be deleted during
	the <span class="command"><strong>transactional-update cleanup-overlays</strong></span> run.
